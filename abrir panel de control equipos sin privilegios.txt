This runs Control Panel:
RunDll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL

But calling that with RunAs opens an Explorer window instead of the Control Panel.
This should work though:
RunAs /User:AdminUserName "control <applet name>"

runas /user:neutron@mets "control intl.cpl"

I've tested with timedate.cpl, and it lets a limited account change date and time, and with nusrmgr.cpl, and it let me create a new Computer Admin account from a limited account.

The Scanner and Camera applet (sticpl.cpl) can't be run from a command line for some reason.
Advanced User Manager - control userpasswords2 does not need to use RunAs, it will prompt for an admin account
