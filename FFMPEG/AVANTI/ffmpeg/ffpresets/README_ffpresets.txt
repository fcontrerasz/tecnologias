	AVANTI - Version 0.7.0 - FFmpeg/Avisynth GUI
	============================================


	Most FFmpeg Win32 builds include a folder named "share" or "ffpresets"
	from where you can copy a number of predefined x264 presets to this folder.

	Avanti supports the use of FFmpeg presets. For more details, read the
	"FFmpeg presets" section in the "Avanti-help.chm".

	The two already included presets are used in a example template.
