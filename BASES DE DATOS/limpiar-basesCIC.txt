CIC has settings which can be used to enable automatic purging of your database. These settings are located in several places within Interaction Administrator.

For Call Detail records and Agent/Workgroup statistics and most other logs, go to the Report Logs container under System Configuration. Each individual log has a Retention tab which sets how long records are to be saved in the database. By default it is 400 days.

The tables you mention below look like Tracker tables, which are configured in a different container. Go to the Interaction Tracker container in Interaction Administrator and open Configuration. There is a Data Purging tab where you have to enable data purging (disabled by default) and set how many days of data you want to keep.

Interaction Recorder Configuration also has a Data Purging tab where you would have to enable data purging (disabled by default) and choose how many days of data to save.
