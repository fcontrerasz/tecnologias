NOTE: Before doing the following work around first take (DATA) .mdf, (LOG) .log files in the DATA folder of MSSQL into some other drive.... 
Once upon a time I too got same issue... I found that my master database is corrupted...
The following is the work around which is worked for me.....

1) First of all, start MSSQL as console (-c) in single user mode(-m)
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10_50.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Binn>sqlservr.exe -c -m -sMSSQLSERVER -T3608

NOTE:
3608 --> Starts SQL and recovers only the master database. 

Now master database is recovered..

2) Secondly i got this error: Unable to open the physical file 
"e:\sql10_main_t.obj.x86fre\sql\mkmastr\databases\objfre\i386\model.mdf". Operating system e
rror 3: "3(The system cannot find the path specified.)".
Error: 17204, FCB::Open failed: Could not open file e:\sql10_main_t.obj.x86fre\sql\mkmastr\databases\objfre\i386\model.mdf for file number 1. OS error: 3(The system cannot find the path specified.).

i figured out that e:\ is not at all available in my system.

Fix for above error is as follows:
************************

C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10_50.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Binn>NET START MSSQLSERVER /f /T3608
The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service is starting.
The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service was started successfully.

C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10_50.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Binn>SQLCMD -sMSSQLSERVER
1> SELECT name, physical_name, state_desc FROM sys.master_files ORDER BY database_id;
2> go

Now notice those wrong file names; and run following commands ...

Note: you need to change the file name location (where the original .mdf, .ldf files are available in ur system. In my point of view 'c:\model.mdf' and soon) ..

1>ALTER DATABASE model MODIFY FILE ( NAME = modeldev, FILENAME = 'c:\model.mdf');
2>ALTER DATABASE model MODIFY FILE ( NAME = modellog, FILENAME = 'c:\modellog.ldf');
3> go

1>ALTER DATABASE msdb MODIFY FILE ( NAME = MSDBData, FILENAME = 'c:\MSDBData.mdf');
2>ALTER DATABASE msdb MODIFY FILE ( NAME = MSDBLog, FILENAME = 'c:\MSDBLog.ldf');
3>go

1>ALTER DATABASE tempdb MODIFY FILE ( NAME = tempdev, FILENAME = 'c:\temp.mdf');
2>ALTER DATABASE tempdb MODIFY FILE ( NAME = templog, FILENAME = 'c:\temp.ldf');
3>go

1> SELECT name, physical_name, state_desc FROM sys.master_files ORDER BY database_id;
2> go

Now you will get modified file paths where you have respective file paths. Changing the paths as described above worked, but still I was not able to log in.
--To list the users
1> select loginname from master..syslogins; 
2>go
My windows account was mising, so I have added it:> 

1> CREATE LOGIN [COMPUTERNAME\USERNAME] FROM WINDOWS;
Then I was able to login with Management Studio with Windows Authentication.

--Give sysadmin rights to ur login acccount
1> EXEC sp_addsrvrolemember 'domainName\WindowsUserName', 'sysadmin';
2> go
1> SELECT loginname, sysadmin FROM master..syslogins;
2> go
You can see the login users list
1> exit

C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQLServer\MSSQL10_50.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Binn>NET STOP MSSQLSERVER
The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service is stopping.
The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service was stopped successfully.

Then i enabled service broker for msdb database.

Finally i attached all user databases to my instance...
